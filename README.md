This is my repository for ideas I would like to develop in the future.

#### General
* An app that consolidates theatrical box office data from across the country and displays data sets inuitively, allowing box office performance comparisons between a select group of theaters.
* Commercial website for a Kombucha company using Wordpress, allowing for detailed company offerings information, along with a secure online store that collects customer data and makes said data available for marketing initiatives.
* Educational flashcard app; user provides key terms and definitions. The UI allows the user to quiz him/her/their-self on relevant information. Target audience = students.

#### Comedy
* Informational website for lovers of stand-up comedy. Create historical/chronological map of stand-up comics and their influences, while featuring famous jokes and video clips.
* Joke-writing App. User submits a subject matter, and general tone (i.e. sarcastic, light-hearted, silly), and the app produces a joke.

#### Greater Good
* How-To-Help Website; For any emergency, crisis, or sociological/environmental phenomenon --- users can find a multitude of resources offering opportunities to contribute and help. For example, during and after Hurricane Harvey, a Californian can find a consolidated list of ways to help those affected by the hurricane in Texas.

#### Ruby (on Rails)
* Build an app using Ruby
* Low-Res PC Game, an homage to Pac-Man, etc.

#### Python


#### CSS/Design/Sketch


#### C#


#### Android/iOS
* Mobile App that allows 12-Step Program members to hold virtual meetings and/or create/maintain virtual sober communities, while also maintaining anonymity.
