This is my repository for ideas I would like to develop in the future.

#### General
* A [React-Redux app](https://github.com/maxobaxo/d-and-d-form) that allows users to create their own character a la Dungeons & Dragons, with specific attributes and alignment.
* An app that consolidates theatrical box office data from across the country and displays data sets inuitively, allowing box office performance comparisons between a select group of theaters.
* Commercial website for a Kombucha company using Wordpress, allowing for detailed company offerings information, along with a secure online store that collects customer data and makes said data available for marketing initiatives.
* Educational flashcard app; user provides key terms and definitions. The UI allows the user to quiz him/her/their-self on relevant information. Target audience = students.

#### Comedy
* Informational website for lovers of stand-up comedy. Create historical/chronological map of stand-up comics and their influences, while featuring famous jokes and video clips.
* Joke-writing App. User submits a subject matter, and general tone (i.e. sarcastic, light-hearted, silly), and the app produces a joke.

#### Greater Good
* How-To-Help Website; For any emergency, crisis, or sociological/environmental phenomenon --- users can find a multitude of resources offering opportunities to contribute and help. For example, during and after Hurricane Harvey, a Californian can find a consolidated list of ways to help those affected by the hurricane in Texas.
* Philanthro-Me: an app that allows users to keep track of their on-going contributions to charitable organizations, check their donation history. The app would also help charitable organizations reach potential donors, by featuring their cause/mission in the app.

#### Ruby (on Rails)
* Build an app using Ruby
* Low-Res PC Game, an homage to Pac-Man, etc.
* Create app to manage a fantasy football league, with different permissions for league manager and team coordinator.
* Build an API using rails
* Create a testable, functional user-authentication feature in a Rails app.

#### CSS/Design
* Use Sketch to build a library of wireframes to be used for future projects

#### C#
* Create and maintain a (relational) SQL database using a C# app (maybe a to-do list)
* A Yelp-type review site where users can submit reviews for local businesses/restaurants/etc.

#### Android/iOS
* Mobile App that allows 12-Step Program members to hold virtual meetings and/or create/maintain virtual sober communities, while also maintaining anonymity.

#### Drupal
* Create module "Queen Attack" to evaluate whether or not a chess piece is in the Queen's path of destruction, given a set of coordinates.
* Create and save custom themes and sub-themes in Drupal to use on future projects.
